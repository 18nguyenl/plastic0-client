Plastic0 Client
==================

# This is a client to interface with the `plastic0` MariaDB.

To get started, make sure the database is set up.

# Technologies we use
- Node.js
- React.js
- Express.js
- Antd Design System / Library
- MySQL (MariaDB)

# Required Technologies

1. Node.js (15.3.0)

# Steps for development environment

run

```bash
$  npm install
```

then

```bash
$ npm run start
```

It should open directly to your browser.

Now on a separate terminal window (or with your `react` server process in the background), run

```bash
$ node server.js
```

# To build for production

$ npm run build
```

Static files will be in `/build` to be deployed.
